My Yearly Record, an easy way to create lists of your interested books or tv shows while making friends with common interest

## Description

This project is to create responsive list to keep track of book and tv shows. The user is able to search and add tv shows and books to their list as well as delete them. The user is also able to add friends, to watch their list and delete a friend.

The idea was born from spotify wrapped. We wanted a way to keep track of the TV shows and books we consumed over a year. This application allows you to search for shows and books. Once you find one you are interested in you can save it to your list. Additionally, you are able to add friends to follow what they are watching and reading. If you select a show or book you are no longer interested in your can remove them from your saved lists.
